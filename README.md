# *"Melee Empirical Strategy Solver"*
## Overview
"Chess engine"-style analysis of Smash Melee is impossible. Melee is an imperfect-information game; it is played in continuous-time (kind of); and, depending on definition, the set of legal moves is a bit larger than chess's. Our strategies for "solving" the game must immediately diverge from e.g. min-max tree searching.

MESS aims to act as an analysis and training tool that measures and explains the mixup, and thus determines the best *strategy* in a situation rather than the best *move*.
