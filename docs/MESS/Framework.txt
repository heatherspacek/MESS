Created Friday 24 November 2023

[draft of how the components will work together.]

INPUT: 

Step 1: compose a matrix of Basic Strategies


Step 2: mutate and adapt a subset of the Basic Strategies
	Mutation should encompass: 
		--reacting to different things (we know which opposing strategies are good against each candidate, so that can be used to inform additional reaction branches.
		--replacing Attack Actions with Meta-Actions (e.g. overshoot nair can become "any overshoot") ** think on this more.
	
	
	
	(Assumption: that a bad [totally dominated] Basic Strat will not become a very good one)
	(How do chess engines do tree pruning??)

OUTPUT:
