- work towards MVP!!!
- "dashdance builder"... or just advancing, retreating, in-place
- nicer representations for triggers and responses
- implement expand/collapse all
- take a bite out of serialization problem
- situation setup!
- some non-control rendering, e.g. can i click and drag a little fox around a stage (to set initial position)?
- logging console for live-testing
- informative headers e.g. "Triggers (8 total)"
